# Performance Optimization in Java

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates performance optimization techniques in Java. The initial implementation is optimized to reduce execution time.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using Maven:
    mvn clean install


## Run the application:
java -jar target/performance-optimization-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


## Optimization Techniques

- Replaced repetitive computations with array storage.
- Utilized efficient looping structures.

## CI Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

## Expected Results

The optimized code should execute faster compared to the initial implementation, demonstrating reduced execution time in milliseconds.

## Execution Time

- Initial implementation: [x]ms
- Optimized implementation: [y]ms
